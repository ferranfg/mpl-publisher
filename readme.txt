== Description ==

MPL-Publisher üìö creates an ebook, print-ready PDF book, EPUB for KDP, or Audiobook MP3 converting your WordPress posts.

If you are looking for a WordPress ebook generator or you are a self-publishing author ‚úçÔ∏è, it will solve the "how to publish my digital book" problem, doing it in the simplest possible way üëå. Convert your posts to book, posts to ebook (EPUB compatible with Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing KDP), posts to PDF print-ready, posts to MS Word (Docx), posts to Audiobook (MP3)‚Ä¶ etc.

Writing a successful book is a challenge by itself and self-publishing an ebook can be pretty painful without the right tools. But with Kindle Direct Publishing (Amazon's self-publishing platform), and other platforms of self-publishing, self-publishing a book, ebook, or audiobook can even be easy.

It is free to self-publish on the most popular book and ebook platforms, like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), NOOK Press, or KOBO. You just need a formatted ebook file to load to the self-publishing platforms. This is your completed, edited manuscript in specific formats: .epub for Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) and other stores, or PDF for print-ready books.

With our plugin, you can create an ebook from your WordPress posts in a matter of seconds. If you already have a WordPress site, you are ready to start selling online your self-published books.

The plugin is full of features (check the features section and roadmap to future releases) and open to any comments, bugs, or issues you may have. Use the [MPL-Publisher Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/mpl-publisher/).
