== Description ==

MPL-Publisher üìö creates an ebook, print-ready PDF book, EPUB for KDP, or Audiobook MP3 directly from your WordPress posts.

If you are a self-publishing author ‚úçÔ∏è, it will solve the "how to publish my digital book" problem, doing it the simplest possible way üëå. Convert your posts to EPUB, print-ready PDF, mp3, Kindle, Mobi‚Ä¶ etc.

Writing a book successfully is a challenge by itself and publishing an ebook can be pretty painful without the right tools. But with Kindle Direct Publishing, Amazon publishing, and other forms of self-publishing, publishing an ebook or audiobook can even be easy.

It is free to self-publish on the most popular ebook platforms. You just need a formatted ebook file to load to the publishing platforms. This is your completed, edited manuscript in specific formats: .mobi for Amazon, .ePub for the other stores, or PDF for print-ready books.

With our plugin, you can download in a matter of seconds your eBook from your WordPress blog in these formats. If you already have a WordPress site, you are ready to start selling online your self-published book.

The plugin is full of features (check the features section and roadmap to future releases) and open to any comments, bugs, or issues you may have. Use the MPL-Publisher Support Forum.

- Set basic information about your book: Title, Description, Authors, ISBN, Publisher, Book Cover.
- Download your eBook as EPUB2.0, EPUB3.0, Markdown, Microsoft Word (Docx), Mobi, print-ready PDF, HTML for Kindle Direct Publishing, and Audiobook (mp3).
